    #
    # Two things decide what that identity actually says, and both are easy to get wrong:
    #   * the workflow FILE is the one holding the `cosign sign` step (docker-build.yml), because
    #     Fulcio takes the SAN from the OIDC job_workflow_ref claim - NOT the entrypoint workflow
    #     that calls it. Naming the caller (docker-publish.yml) is a regexp that can never match.
    #   * the REF is the caller's ref, since docker-build.yml is invoked as a local reusable
    #     workflow. The release path (auto-tag.yml, on a version-bump merge) therefore signs at
    #     refs/heads/main; refs/tags/v* only appears when a human pushes a v* tag directly, because
    #     a GITHUB_TOKEN tag push cannot re-trigger a workflow. Both are accepted below.
    # So the boundary this enforces is "built and signed by this repo's build workflow via GitHub
    # OIDC" - branch / latest / sha images satisfy it too. That is fine: the updater only ever pulls
    # <repo>:<target-version> as named by the control plane (see main._tick), so it cannot drift onto
    # a floating tag, and it applies the exact digest cosign attested rather than re-resolving.
    #
    # Defaulted to this image's own publishing workflow so every deploy shape (docker run, compose,
