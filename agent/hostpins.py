"""Static hostname -> address pins, so an operator can bypass DNS for a name it will not answer.

Two sources, both optional, checked before the resolver:

* ``/host-hosts`` - the **host's** ``/etc/hosts``, mounted read-only by the install command. This
  exists because editing ``/etc/hosts`` on the machine is the first thing anyone reaches for when a
  name will not resolve, and it silently does nothing for the agent: a container gets docker's own
  ``/etc/hosts``, even under ``--network host``, because host networking shares the network
  namespace and not the mount namespace. Exactly the same shape as the CA-trust trap ``tlsconf``
  fixes, and fixed the same way - mount what the host has and read it here.
* ``ARES_HOST_ALIASES`` - explicit ``name=address`` pairs, for a pin the host file does not carry.

The file is re-read when its mtime changes, so an operator can add a name and have the running
agent pick it up on its next dial. That is the whole point of preferring the mount over
``--add-host``: a pin costs an edit, never a container recreate.

A pin is authorization-neutral. It only supplies the address DNS would have; every address it
yields still goes through the same registered-networks / ares-approved check in ``_dial_address``,
so pinning a name cannot widen what this agent will dial.
